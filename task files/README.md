# starter code for ELEC241 P1 2023

In this repository, you will find the files needed to get started

* FPGA - starter project for Quartus
* MCU - starter workspace for Mbed Studio
* Hardware - datasheets + files used for testing your hardware
* lib - Leave this. Files used by Quartus


Should should use this as a starting point for your coursework.
All pin mappings have been setup and tested so you can focus on your logic.

You should obtain this repository via GitHub classroom. If you obtain it another way, it might be the wrong version!

The Hardware folder contains pre-built Mbed and FPGA binaries you can use to program your boards to check your hardware is constructed correctly. Always program the MCU first.

## Tasks
We suggest you do the following:

* Before connecting the ribbon cable to the Nucleo board, program the MCU with one of the test binaries (safety precaution)
* Complete construction of your cables and boards (if needed)
* Connect everything in accordance with the image in the coursework spec
* Use the test binaries in the Hardware folder to check your hardware. Read the README files in each
* Read the comments on the top level schematic. Some connections are made for demo purposes only.
